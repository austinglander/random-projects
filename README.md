For random little scripts and small projects

Maybe I will learn markdown someday lol


## 01 - wordsearch
My friend shared a fun algorithm problem with me and I had an itch to solve it in Python

## 02 - voxelgrid
A friend of mine has a really neat 8x8x8 voxel grid of LEDs that can be controlled via Python. I wanted to write some scripts for him to run on it.
