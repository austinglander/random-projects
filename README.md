# random-projects
For random little scripts and small projects

Maybe I will learn markdown someday lol

## 01 - tboi-wooden-nickel-analysis
I stumbled across a seemingly impossibly lucky seed in The Binding of Isaac. I had to see for myself just how lucky I got (Spoiler: about 1 in 1,409,244)

## 02 - brainfuck
I had never messed with an esolang before, so I decided to try out brainfuck. Maybe I'll write an interpreter someday.

## 03 - wordsearch
My friend shared a fun algorithm problem with me and I had an itch to solve it in Python

## 04 - voxelgrid
A friend of mine has a really neat 8x8x8 voxel grid of LEDs that can be controlled via Python. I wanted to write some scripts for him to run on it.
