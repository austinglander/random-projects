# Wasd can control a paddle on the left plane, arrow keys can control a paddle on the right plane.
# Simulate collisions with the ball and the paddles
# When the ball passes a paddle, wipe the screen and display a score counter
    # Could use a function that takes in two score values and outputs a frame displaying that score
# Use vectors to track precise positions, and round when rendering
